                            User.</p>
                        <h2>Payments</h2>
                        <p>The Application is free of charge; separate approval shall be obtained for the sales prices,
                            including all taxes, for in-application purchasing. The User hereby declares and accepts
                            that the Company may unilaterally alter the Application price, in-application prices,
                            campaigns and packages at any time, and that the User shall regularly check the update and
                            application information related to the alterations. For the cash paid memberships; the User

                            valid until the date of expiration.

                            Paid Services: Certain services of the Company may be subject to payments now or in the
                            future (the “Paid Services”). Any payment terms presented to the User in the process of
                            using or signing up for a Paid Service are deemed part of this Agreement.

                            Billing: The Company uses a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to bill
                            Users through a payment account (“Billing Account”) for use of the Paid Services.

                            The processing of payments will be subject to the terms, conditions and privacy policies of
                            the Payment Processor in addition to this Agreement. The Company is not responsible for any
                            error by the Payment Processor. By choosing to use Paid Services, the User agrees to pay the
                            Company, through the Payment Processor, all charges at the prices then in effect for any use
                            of such Paid Services in accordance with the applicable payment terms that are set out
                            alongside the Paid Service in the Application or on the Website, and authorizes the Company,
                            through the Payment Processor, to charge the User’s chosen payment provider (“Payment
                            Method”). The User agrees to make payment using that selected Payment Method each billing
                            cycle of the Paid Service. The Company reserves the right to correct any errors or mistakes
                            that it makes even if it has already requested or received payment.

                            Payment Method: The terms of the User’s payment will be based on their Payment Method and
                            may be determined by agreements between them and the financial institution, credit card
                            issuer or other provider of their chosen Payment Method. In case the Company, through the
                            Payment Processor, does not receive payment from the User, the User agrees to pay all
                            amounts due on their Billing Account upon the first demand.</p>

                            there is a one-time charge, followed by recurring period charges as agreed to by the User.
                            By choosing a recurring payment plan, the User acknowledges that such Services have an

                            prior to cancellation. The Company may submit periodic charges (e.g., monthly) without
                            further authorization from the User, until the User provides prior notice (receipt of which
                            is confirmed by the Company) that they have terminated this authorization or wish to change
                            their payment method. Such notice will not affect charges submitted before the Company
                            reasonably could act. To terminate this authorization or change payment method, go to Apple
                            Store or Play Store subscription page depending on the purchase.

                            Current Information Required. The User must provide current, complete and accurate
                            information for their billing account. They must promptly update all information to keep
                            their billing account current, complete and accurate (such as a change in billing address,
                            credit card number, or credit card expiration date), and they must promptly notify the
                            Company or its payment processor if their payment method is canceled (e.g., for loss or
                            theft) or if they become aware of a potential breach of security, such as the unauthorized

                            disclosure or use of their user name or password. Changes to such information can be made at
                            Apple Store or Play Store security page depending on your purchase if the User fails to
                            provide any of the aforementioned information, they agree that the Company may continue
                            charging them for any use of paid services under their billing account unless the User has
                            terminated their paid services as set forth above.

                            Change in Amount Authorized: If the amount to be charged to the User’s Billing Account
                            varies from the amount preauthorized by them (other than due to the imposition or change in
                            the amount of state sales taxes), the User has the right to receive, and the Company shall
                            provide, notice of the amount to be charged and the date of the charge before the scheduled
                            date of the transaction. Any agreement the User has with their payment provider will govern
                            their use of their Payment Method. The User agrees that the Company may accumulate charges
                            incurred and submit them as one or more aggregate charges during or at the end of each
                            billing cycle.</p>

                        <p>Reaffirmation of Authorization: The User’s non- termination or continued use of a Paid

                            that Paid Service.

                            The Company may submit those charges for payment and the User will be responsible for such
                            charges. This does not waive the Company’s right to seek payment directly from the User. The
                            User’s charges may be payable in advance, in arrears, per usage, or as otherwise described
                            when they initially selected to use the Paid Service.

                            However, we may charge a reasonable fee if your request is clearly unfounded, repetitive or
                            excessive. Alternatively, we may refuse to comply with your request in these

                            What we may need from you? We may need to request specific information from you to help us
                            confirm your identity and ensure your right to access your personal data (or to exercise any
                            of your other rights). This is a security measure to ensure that personal data is not

                            purposes. In some cases, we may demonstrate that we have compelling legitimate grounds to

                            <b>Marketing</b><br>

                            We use personal data for marketing purposes. This includes informing you about products and
                            services that we think may be of interest to you and providing you with related materials
                            such as news items and blog posts. We would contact you for marketing purposes by email,
                            telephone or post with your consent and would stop any such communication upon your request.
                            You might also be contacted through any channel for other purposes – for example, as part of
                            our ordinary relationship management activity and as necessary to deliver the Service.

                            We use personal data for relationship management purposes. Relationship management is the
                            ongoing maintenance of our relationship with our customers. This could include activities
                            such as letting you know about product changes or planned maintenance activity, contacting
                            you with billing enquiries, dealing with your enquiries, or asking you for feedback or about
                            what sorts of products, services you want us to develop.
                            <br><b>Providing services</b><br>


                            Sometimes we might need to use your personal data to provide you with information, services
                            and facilities that you have asked for. For example, if you ask us for more information
                            about one of our apps or ask for assistance.
                            <br><b> Monitoring and improving our Service</b> <br>


                            We may use information such as how different people navigate around our mobile apps and
                            websites, how long they spend on particular pages, how and when they interact with our
                            Service, whether they download any of our content or watch videos in order to help improve

                        <h2>WHAT ARE OUR LEGAL GROUNDS FOR HANDLING PERSONAL DATA?</h2>
                        <p>Generally speaking, we rely on your consent to make contact with you by email for marketing
                            purposes. You can withdraw that consent and ask us to delete your information at any time by
                            contacting us directly via support@equestridefitness.com – please see section 6 below.

                            In relation to sensitive personal information, such as health information that you share
                            with us or our employees or agents via our Service, we process this sensitive personal
                            information only with your explicit consent. By providing that information in the course of
                            using our Service, you are consenting to us doing so explicitly. You may revoke that consent
                            at any time using the features made available to you in the Service.

                            The United Kingdom’s data protection law also allows the use of personal data where the
                            benefits (or “legitimate interests”) of doing so outweigh the possible negative implications
                            for the relevant individuals. These are the grounds on which we usually rely when we use
                            your information for anything other than making contact with you by email for marketing
                            purposes with your consent. <br>

                            In some circumstances, we may have other grounds to process personal data for example:<br>

                            Necessary for performance of a contract with the relevant individual, or to take steps for
                            entering into a contract. For example, if you sign up to one of our products or services
                            online or download our app, it will often be necessary for us to use your details in order
                            to provide that product or service and you must consent to our use of your details to the
                            extent required to provide that product or service in order to use that product or
                            service.<br>

                            Necessary in order to comply with a legal obligation. For example, some regulators,
                            government bodies and courts have powers to order us to provide personal information and,
                            like any other organisation, we sometimes have to comply with their requests and we whilst
                            we may make commercially reasonable efforts to defend personal information from unjustified
                            regulatory or governmental access, we cannot make any guarantee about the extent to which we
                            are able to do so.</p>

                            or on behalf of other organisations and we have taken contractual and operational steps to
                            protect any personal data shared for these purposes with third parties.</p>
